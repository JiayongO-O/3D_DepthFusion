# DepthFusion_3DReconstruction
This is the collection of 3D reconstruction and depth fusion methods

# Depth Fusion
1.TSDF: https://github.com/andyzeng/tsdf-fusion

2.Mobile Fusion: https://github.com/rogermm14/rec3D

3.RealTime Kinect Fusion: https://github.com/rogermm14/rec3D

4.MV Stereopsis: https://github.com/kysucix/gipuma   https://github.com/kysucix/fusibile

5.Gipmuma: https://github.com/kysucix/gipuma (clear structure and provide many useful operations: build mesh, rander, disparity->depth->point cloud)

6.COLMAP: https://colmap.github.io/ (more complicated and have matlab, python et.al interface)

7.OctNet: https://github.com/griegler/octnetfusion (a network for depth fusion and reconstruction)

8.FastFusion: https://github.com/tum-vision/fastfusion (a implmentation of TSDF, which achieves real-time 3D reconstruction)
